%%%  Path to MNPBEM directory  %%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To use the MNPBEM toolbox, you must add at the beginning of each session
the MNPBEM17 directory and all subdirectories to the Matlab path, e.g. 
by calling

  >> addpath( genpath( 'MNPBEMDIR' ) );

Here, MNPBEMDIR is the *full* directory name of the MNPBEM17 toolbox.  

The MNPBEM14 Toobox was developed under Matlab 8.6.0.

%%%  Help pages  %%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To set up the MNPBEM help pages, you must install them once.  
To this end, you must

  (1)  change in Matlab to the main directory of the MNPBEM toolbox, and
  (2)  run the file makemnpbemhelp.
  
A detailed help of the Toolbox and a number of demo files are then 
available in the Matlab help pages which can be found on the start page 
of the help browser under Supplemental Software.
